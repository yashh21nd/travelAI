## üìû Need Help?

If you run into any issues during setup:
1. **Affiliate Program Support**: Contact the partner program directly
2. **Technical Issues**: Check the implementation guides I provided
3. **Legal Questions**: Consider consulting with a lawyer for complex cases
4. **Performance Optimization**: Use Google Analytics data to guide decisions

**Remember**: Your technical foundation is already excellent! Most travel websites don't have the sophisticated affiliate tracking system you've built. Focus on getting approved by partners and optimizing for conversions.

**Estimated Timeline to Revenue**: 2-4 weeks to first commission, 3-6 months to significant income ($2,000+/month).

Good luck! üöÄ
